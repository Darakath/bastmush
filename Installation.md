# READ THIS FIRST #
  * Do not pick and choose from the download, many of the plugins depend on other plugins which are automatically loaded.  Copy the **ENTIRE** zip file when following these instructions
  * Do not have multiple folders with my plugins under the MUSHclient directory
  * <font size='5'>When adding plugins with File->Plugins->Add, do not add EVERY plugin, just add the ones you want to use.</font>
