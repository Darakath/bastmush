# Help output #
  * If you want help sent to the output screen, add "text" after the help command for a plugin
    * so for bast\_hunt, it would be "bh help text"
  * to change this to be the default for all helps, type "plugins set helpoutputtext true"

# Spellup Plugin #
  * The miniwin\_spellup plugin actually just calls all commands from the bast\_spellup plugin. So most anything that the miniwin\_spellup plugin does can be done from the command line with bast\_spellup.
