= Introduction =

This is a modified version of Nick's Aardwolf Spellup Plugin. 
The original is here http://www.gammon.com.au/mushclient/plugins/Aardwolf/Aardwolf_Spellups.xml 

= Differences from Nick's Plugin ==
 * no more spell timer, it looks for the specific spell that it tried to cast and waits for the spell tags.  I have had no issues with this
 * You can have spells that are blocked by other spells
  * For example "spellup block 68 121" will block casting of "protection good" if "inertial barrier" is active.  Therefore, if you have "protection good" before "inertial barrier" in your spellup list, it will only cast "protection good" when "inertial barrier" wears off.
 * You can disable a spell without taking it out of your list
  * I use this for when I want to vis with sneak
 * Add a spell to a specific place in the list
 * Will also work with spellup skills, such as nimble cunning, sneak, hide, etc..

= Troubleshooting =
 * make sure tags are on by typing "tags on"
 * "spellup debug" will turn debugging on or look in the spellup plugin for "fdebug = false" and change it to "fdebug = true", this will give you a lot of debugging output
 * paste whatever errors and debugging information you get into a post on the mushclient site
