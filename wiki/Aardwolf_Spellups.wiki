= Introduction =
 * Author: Nick Gammon/Bast
 * This is a modified version of Nick's Aardwolf Spellup Plugin. 
    The original is here http://www.gammon.com.au/mushclient/plugins/Aardwolf/Aardwolf_Spellups.xml 

= Differences from Nick's Plugin ==
 * no more spell timer, it looks for the specific spell that it tried to cast and waits for the spell tags.  I have had no issues with this
 * You can have spells that are blocked by other spells
  * For example "spellup block + 68 121" will block casting of "protection good" if "inertial barrier" is active.  Therefore, if you have "protection good" before "inertial barrier" in your spellup list, it will only cast "protection good" when "inertial barrier" wears off.
 * You can disable a spell without taking it out of your list
  * I use this for when I want to vis with sneak
 * Add a spell to a specific place in the list
 * Will also work with spellup skills, such as nimble cunning, sneak, etc..

= Installation ==
 * Required 
  * [http://www.gammon.com.au/mushclient/plugins/Aardwolf/Spellups.mcl Spellups.mcl ] World in the directory <Mushclient Install Dir>\worlds\Aardwolf 
  * Nick's [http://www.gammon.com.au/mushclient/plugins/Aardwolf/telnet_options.lua telnet_options.lua] script in the directory <Mushclient Install Dir>\worlds\plugins\Aardwolf (included in the Aardwolf Mushclient)
  * Nick's [http://www.gammon.com.au/mushclient/plugins/Aardwolf/Create_World_File.xml Create_World_File.xml] Plugin in the directory <Mushclient Install Dir>\worlds\plugins\Aardwolf (included in the Aardwolf Mushclient)
  * Nick's [http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/?id=8776 Stats_Detector.xml] Plugin in the directory <Mushclient Install Dir>\worlds\plugins\Aardwolf (included in the Aardwolf Mushclient)
  * [broadcast_state] in the directory <Mushclient Install Dir>\worlds\plugins\Aardwolf
 * see the [Download] Page, and copy the file into worlds\plugins\Aardwolf

= Troubleshooting =
 * make sure tags are on by typing "tags on"
 * "spellup debug" will turn debugging on or look in the spellup plugin for "fdebug = false" and change it to "fdebug = true", this will give you a lot of debugging output
 * paste whatever errors and debugging information you get into a post on the mushclient site
 * there are several things that have to happen before spellups will begin
  1 must get spells list from slist
  1 must get a statmon line, aardwolf only sends statmon lines when you would normally get a prompt, so you must do something to get a prompt (such as sending an enter/return) 
  1 must be active (no resting, sitting, sleeping, note writing, etc...)

= Ideas =
 * convert to a miniwindow
 * use short names for spells and have the user be able to set them
  * i.e. {{{spellup short <spell or spellnumber> <shortname>}}}
 * have different views
  * i.e. only see spells that are going to wear off in the next 60 secs
  *  only see spells that are bad
