= Introduction =

This is a modified version of Balaam's moonbot Plugin to use a miniwindow. 
The original is here http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/bbshowpost.php?id=8146&page=2

= Differences from Balaam's Plugin ==
 * can now show moons as a miniwindow
 * uses the telopt ticks instead of the printed tick
  * this is because printed ticks are not sent when note writing, etc..

= Installation ==
 * Required 
  * [miniwin] and all of its dependencies
  * [Tick_Detector] and all of its dependencies
 * download from trunk [http://code.google.com/p/bastmush/source/browse/trunk/worlds/plugins/Aardwolf/Aardwolf_moons.xml here] (make a note of the revision, it will help troubleshoot) or checkout with subversion and copy into the directory <Mushclient Install Dir>\worlds\plugins\Aardwolf

= Troubleshooting =
 * the miniwindow will not show until you have seen all 3 of the moons rise or fall at least once
