#summary How to install v5 and above
#labels Featured

= READ THIS FIRST =
 * Do not pick and choose from the download, many of the plugins depend on other plugins which are automatically loaded.  Copy the *ENTIRE* zip file when following these instructions

= New Installation in the Aardwolf MUSHclient (Or any MUSHclient) =
 * Download from the [http://code.google.com/p/bastmush/downloads/list Downloads] page.
 * Unzip into your plugins directory
 * Use File->Plugins to Add the plugins you want to use

= Upgrading from v5 to v6 =
 * Close mushclient
 * delete all the files in the directory that my plugins are in
 * copy the files from the new zip into the directory
 * open mushclient, you will get warnings that some plugins could not be found, those will be ones that were removed

= Migrating data from v4 =
 * I would recommend moving data from v4 into the new Aardwolf MUSHclient

== Process ==
 * Download the new Aardwolf MUSHclient from http://www.aardwolf.com
 * Unzip the new client and start it, connect to Aardwolf, logout and close the client

=== Moving data ===
 * Copy and overwrite
  * all files in OldMUSHInstallDir/logs to NewMUSHInstallDir/logs
  * Aardwolf_bookmarks.db and Aardwolf.db from the OldMUSHInstallDir to NewMUSHInstallDir
