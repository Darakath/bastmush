= READ THIS FIRST =

 * Download from the [http://code.google.com/p/bastmush/downloads/list Downloads] page.
 * Copy the Folder from the zip into MUSHclient>Worlds>Plugins
 * Use File->Plugins to Add the plugins you want to use

= Upgrading an existing install =
 * Close mushclient
 * copy the files from the new zip into the same directory that my plugins are already installed in
 * open mushclient, you will get warnings that some plugins could not be found, those will be ones that were removed

= Migrating data to a new installation =
 * Copy all files in OldMUSHInstallDir/logs to NewMUSHInstallDir/logs
