= Installation in the New Aardwolf MUSHclient (Or any MUSHclient install) =
 * Download from the [http://code.google.com/p/bastmush/downloads/list Downloads] page.
 * Unzip into your plugins directory
 * Use File->Plugins to Add the plugins you want to use

= Upgrading from v5 to v6 =
 * Close mushclient
 * delete all the files in the directory that my plugins are in
 * copy the files from the new zip into the directory
 * open mushclient, you will get warnings that some plugins could not be found, those will be ones that were removed

= Migrating data from v4 =
 * I would recommend moving data from v4 into the new Aardwolf MUSHclient

 * Unzip the new client and start it, connect to Aardwolf, logout and close the client

=== Moving data ===
 * Copy and overwrite
  * all files in OldMUSHInstallDir/logs to NewMUSHInstallDir/logs
  * Aardwolf_bookmarks.db and Aardwolf.db from the OldMUSHInstallDir to NewMUSHInstallDir
