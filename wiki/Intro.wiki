#summary An intro to the scripts that are here.
#labels featured

This is a repository for [http://mushclient.com Mushclient] scripts.  Some of them are modified plugins and most of them are geared toward [http://aardwolf.com Aardwolf Mud].

* These plugins require at least version MUSHclient version 4.4, but I would suggest the latest version *

== miniwindow plugins notes ==
 * if any of my miniwindows are used, you will also want to use [miniwin_tabbar]
 * can be moved by dragging from the titlebar
 * the titlebar and tabbar can be hidden
 * can have tabs for different information
 * The miniwindows come with two popup menus
  * Left click for the miniwindow menu where features of the miniwindow can be changed, commands can be run, and the miniwindow reset
