 * Note: this does not differentiate between characters, change the dblocation variable for each character

= Variables of Interest =
 * Campaign related
  * dontlevelnocampaign - set this to true to automatically set noexp at <campaignxp tnl if you haven't done a campaign this level
  * campaignxp - tnl to check to set noexp if you haven't done a campaign this level
  * For example, if you set campaignxp to 500 and dontlevelnocampaign to true then if a campaign hasn't been taken for this level then noexp will be set when xp to the next level is < 500.
