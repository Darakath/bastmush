= Help output =
 * If you want help sent to the output screen, add "text" after the help command for a plugin
  * so for bast_hunt, it would be "bh help text"
 * to change this to be the default for all helps, type "plugins set helpoutputtext true"

= Spellup Plugin =
 * The miniwin_spellup plugin actually just calls all commands from the bast_spellup plugin. So most anything that the miniwin_spellup plugin does can be done from the command line with bast_spellup.
