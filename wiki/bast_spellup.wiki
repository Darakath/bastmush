 * disable/enable specific spellups
 * can have spellups that block other spellups from being activated
 * import/export settings
 * can keep settings through remort without having to readd spellups
 * Two options for spelling up others
  * pick spellups that you want to use on others
  * fast option which is basically the mud version of the spellup, It looks through all your spellups and casts the ones that can be cast on others and you have practiced
 * Can toggle spells/skills to be spellups clientside although they are not spellups on the mudside, For example, stealth.
