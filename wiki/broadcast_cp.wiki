Broadcasts when anything happens in a campaign
Broadcasts
   1 - Mob list, get var.mobs and loadstring it
       mobs = { 1 = {name = 'Some name', room = 'Some room', clean = 'A name with some stuff removed'},
              2 = {name = 'Another name', room = 'Another room', clean = 'Another name with some stuff removed'}, }
       It will be resent when a mob is killed and will be nil when a cp is not active
   2 - timer, will be updated every 60 seconds, get var.timer and loadstring it
        timer = {secs = num, text = 'time in text format', days = days, hours = hours, mins = minutes}
   3 - rewards, get var.rewards and loadstring it, this can also be used to check when a cp is finished
        see below
   4 - campaign failed
        see below

Example
  function OnPluginBroadcast (msg, id, name, text)
    if id == "aaa66f81c50828bbbfda7100" and msg == 1 then
      local pvar = GetPluginVariable(  "aaa66f81c50828bbbfda7100", mobs )

      -- get the mobs
      loadstring( pvar )()
      cp_mobs = mobs
    end
  end
