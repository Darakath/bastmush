Broadcasts when anything happens in a gquest
Broadcasts
   1 - gquest available
   2 - gquest joined
   3 - Mob list, get var.mobs and loadstring it
       mobs = { 1 = {name = 'Some name', room = 'Some room', clean = 'A name with some stuff removed', num=number},
              2 = {name = 'Another name', room = 'Another room', clean = 'Another name with some stuff removed', num=number}, }
       It will be resent when a mob is killed and will be nil when a gquest is not active
   4 - rewards get var.gq_info and loadstring it
       see below
   5 - gquest over

Example
  function OnPluginBroadcast (msg, id, name, text)
    if id == "aaa77f81c5408278ccda7100" and msg == 3 then
      local pvar = GetPluginVariable(  "aaa77f81c5408278ccda7100", "mobs" )

      -- get the mobs
      loadstring( pvar )()
      gq_mobs = mobs
