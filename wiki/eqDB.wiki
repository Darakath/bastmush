= Introduction =
 * This plugins saves inventory into a sqlite database
 * Also see [miniwin_eq]

= Installation =
 * See the [Installation] Page
 * The command for this plugin is "eqdb"
  * for help on a specific command, {{{eqdb <cmd> help}}}
  * there is an alias for eqlu that will pass the arguments to {{{eqdb lu}}}

= Extras in the plugin =
 * add an identifier to an item
  * {{{eqdb addid <serial> <identifer>}}}
  * {{{get 49495858}}} will get the item from whatever container it is in
  * for the following mud commands: get, put, remove, wear, ident
   * will substitute identifiers for item serial #s
 * {{{lget/lput <serialorident> <level1> <level2(opt)>}}} - get/put items between level1 and level2 from/into a container  

= Troubleshooting =
 * To reset all eq
  * {{{eqdb refresh}}} then {{{eqdb clean}}}
  * or delete the eqdb.db file in the logs directory and reload the plugin

= Examples =
 * This is how I do portals
  * {{{eqdb addid <bagserial> portbag}}}
  * Then to use a portal I can get it with: {{{get share portbag}}}
  * Also {{{get <serial#forshare>}}} would work
 * Looking up and sorting equipment
  * use the command eqlu
   * sorting all equipment by level
    * {{{eqlu level between 1 and 50 ORDER BY level asc}}}
     * asc means ascending, so the order shown will start with 1 and go to 50 (desc is the opposite of asc)
   * sorting eq in a specific bag
    * {{{eqlu level between 1 and 50 and containerid = 549229115 ORDER BY level asc}}}
     * containerid can be 'Worn' for worn items, 'Inventory' for items in Inventory, or a serial number of a container that you have
