= Introduction =

This is a modified version of Balaam's moonbot Plugin to use a miniwindow. 
The original is here http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/bbshowpost.php?id=8146&page=2

= Differences from Balaam's Plugin ==
 * can now show moons as a miniwindow
 * uses the telopt ticks instead of the printed tick
  * this is because printed ticks are not sent when note writing, etc..
