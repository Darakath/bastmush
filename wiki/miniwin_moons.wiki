= Introduction =
 * Author: Bast
 * This is a modified version of Balaam's moonbot Plugin to use a miniwindow. 
  The original is here http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/bbshowpost.php?id=8146&page=2

= Differences from Balaam's Plugin ==
 * can now show moons as a miniwindow
 * uses the telopt ticks instead of the printed tick
  * this is because printed ticks are not sent when note writing, etc..


= Installation ==
 * Required 
  * [miniwin] and all of its dependencies
  * [class]
  * [pluginhelper] and all of its dependencies
  * [verify]
  * [broadcast_tick] and all of its dependencies
 * see the [Download] Page, and copy the file into worlds\plugins\Aardwolf

= Troubleshooting =
 * the miniwindow will not show until you have seen all 3 of the moons rise or fall at least once

= Screenshots =
